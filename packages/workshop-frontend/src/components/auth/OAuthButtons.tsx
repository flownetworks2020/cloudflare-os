/**
 * Renders a sign-in button per auth-capable gatekeeper vendor. Clicking opens the gatekeeper's
 * OAuth popup with this window as its opener; when the flow finishes, the popup delivers a handoff
 * ticket back here, which is redeemed over RPC for the session token. The ticket is what ties the
 * session to this browser: the sign-in URL alone can be finished by anyone (see connectHandoff.ts).
 * On success the token is stored and the app re-authenticates.
 *
 * The ticket arrives over one of two transports. Normally the popup posts it to its opener. A
 * provider that isolates its pages with COOP severs that opener mid-flow, though (Google stages
 * this), and the handoff page then falls back to a same-origin BroadcastChannel — which reaches us
 * because in production the login page shares an origin with the handoff page. A broadcast has no
 * source to filter on, so a ticket heard there may be another tab's sign-in or an account-connect
 * ticket; the server answers such a claim with null, and we keep listening for ours.

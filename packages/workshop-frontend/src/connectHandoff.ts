 * `window.open()` return null even on success, which is indistinguishable from a pop-up block. The
 * completion page reaches us over a same-origin BroadcastChannel instead (`useConnectHandoffListener`).
 *
 * Under the Vite dev server the Workshop and the gatekeepers are on different origins, so a channel
 * could not reach us; there the popup keeps its opener and the page falls back to `postMessage`. A
 * provider that isolates its pages with COOP severs that opener too, and no channel crosses origins,
 * so such a connect ends in dev on "couldn't reach the Workshop"; production is unaffected, the
 * popup being disowned there anyway. Throws when the browser blocked the popup.

 * transports are watched: a BroadcastChannel named `CONNECT_HANDOFF_MESSAGE_TYPE` (a disowned popup
 * on our own origin; the browser scopes the channel to that origin) and `message` events from the
 * gatekeeper origin (a popup that kept its opener, as under the dev server). Only well-formed
 * envelopes are considered; anything else is ignored silently. A popup that posted is closed once
 * the Workshop has accepted the ticket. A broadcast has no source, so that page repeats its
 * envelope (a tab whose session is mid-reconnect would miss a one-shot) until this tab answers with
 * a `CONNECT_HANDOFF_ACK_MESSAGE_TYPE` envelope once the redemption succeeded, then closes itself.
 *
 * Security rests on the ticket being scoped server-side to the user who started the flow, not on
 * which window sent it. The `sessionStorage` marker `openConnectWindow` sets only decides *which of
 * that user's tabs* redeems a broadcast: the one that opened the popup, surviving a reload, since
 * the storage is per-tab and reload-stable; its siblings stay silent instead of racing it and
 * toasting "expired". The marker is spent only by a successful redemption, so a sibling's or a
 * sign-in ticket heard first (which the server rejects) does not cost this tab its own, and it ages
 * out after the connect-nonce lifetime so an abandoned popup's marker stops racing siblings. A
 * connect whose tab was closed expires and is revoked like an abandoned one. A phished handoff page
 * opened directly in the victim's own browser broadcasts to tabs none of which holds a marker, so
 * nothing even reaches the server; a `message` event needs no marker, its source being the popup
 * this tab itself holds.
 *
 * Pass `null` to listen for nothing: a ticket must be redeemed exactly once, so only one listener may
 * be live per window (see `ConnectHandoffListener` and the blueprint page).

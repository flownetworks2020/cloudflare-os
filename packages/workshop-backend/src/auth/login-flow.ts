// Sign-in via authentication gatekeepers.
//
// Unlike the normal connect-account flow (which runs for an already-logged-in user), login happens
// before we know who the user is. The PublicApi starts a gatekeeper connect flow (in "auth" scope
// mode) with a `LoginConnectCallbackImpl` as the callback and a `PendingLogin` DO to bridge the
// result back to the waiting browser:
//
//   1. PublicApi.startGatekeeperLogin(vendorId) creates a PendingLogin DO (keyed by a random DO id),
//      hands the gatekeeper a LoginConnectCallbackImpl, and returns {url, attempt}, where `attempt`
//      is an RpcStub wrapping the DO (so the client awaits via a capability, never a guessable id).
//   2. The browser opens `url` as a popup, keeping itself as the popup's opener.
//   3. When the gatekeeper finishes, it calls LoginConnectCallbackImpl.complete(user). We read the
//      verified email, resolve/create the email-keyed user DO, mint a session, and deliver the token
//      to the PendingLogin DO under the hash of a fresh handoff ticket, which complete() returns for
//      the gatekeeper's final page to post to its opener (see connect-handoff.ts).
//   4. The opener calls `attempt.claim(ticket)`, and the PendingLogin DO releases the token only for
//      a matching ticket; a ticket for some other attempt is answered with null and changes nothing,
//      whether it arrives before or after this attempt's result has been delivered.
//
// The sign-in URL is a bearer capability, so step 4 is what binds the session to the browser that
// started the attempt: whoever holds `attempt` but never receives the ticket — an attacker who
// phished a victim into finishing the flow — gets nothing, and the unclaimed token expires.
//
// Sign-in only requests minimal scopes and the gatekeeper grant is transient (it self-destructs
// shortly after we read the email) — so login does NOT create a persistent connected account.
// Capability access (repos, docs, billing) is granted later when the user explicitly connects the
// gatekeeper, which requests the full scopes and persists the connection.
//
// Cloudflare is the exception: signing in also links the account for billing, and the gatekeeper
// keeps this callback for that account's lifetime. The PendingLogin DO therefore also records which
// user and account the sign-in produced (`link`), outliving the login result, so expiry notices and
// reconnects for the account reach its user DO.
